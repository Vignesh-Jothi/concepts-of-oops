## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs. It utilizes several key principles to promote reusable and maintainable code.

## Key Concepts

### Classes and Objects

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data and methods that work on the data.
- **Object**: An instance of a class. It contains real values instead of variables.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and methods that work on the data within a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is achieved through method overriding and overloading.

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It helps in reducing programming complexity.

## Advanced Topics

### Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are like templates that can be applied to real-world programming problems.

### SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

### UML Diagrams

Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams are used to visualize the design of a system. They include class diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, etc.

## Examples

This section includes code examples demonstrating the OOP concepts in PHP programming language.
